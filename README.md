# Disease_Diagnosis_System
SW40703 Mini Project


## Motivation
------------------
To get exposure on fuzzy theory and advance fuzzy theory. <br />


## Features
------------------
- Tabbed Window
- Normal, Malaria, Pneumonia, Typhoid and Coronavirus Disease Detection

## Side Note
------------------
Currently we build a total of 30 rules in this system. 
As we did not have enough inputs to generate a larger rule based, some diseases will be marked as 'unknown'.

## Dependencies

- Tkinter 
- Numpy
- PyIT2FLS
